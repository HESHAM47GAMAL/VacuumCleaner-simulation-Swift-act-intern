## Description
<p>丘멛ere I simulate Vaccuum cleaner functionality as when <strong>power on</strong> power of motor go from low power to high power gradually </p>
<p>丘뫯릝뜪an control speed (Low  , meduim & High ) and know bag that store dust is full of when led of pressure be on and speed of motor reduce gradually to low </p>

 ## IDE 
 <p> Keil uVision5 </p>
 
 ## Control Speed
 <p> 丘멷ere will explain how control speed to motors as power come from sin wave 游always look at contex diagram <p/>
 <p> 丘멿ower come from AC power source go through zero crossing detector (ZCD) as work crystal </p>
 <p> 丘메 triac is a type of thyristor, a semiconductor component that is used for AC switching applications. It is a three-terminal device that is used to control the flow of electrical current in AC circuits</p>
 <p> 丘멽ext image will visualize better and control of speed of motor depend on time of firing (give high to motor) and time that I have from 0 to 180 degree every degree take specific time and firing every specific time mean specific degree and at this degree motor will be high until 180 degree and will be high again with next fire </p>

 ## Demo 
 <p> 丘명hen <strong>power on</strong> start with 10 % of power and go to 50% power  by applying <strong>Soft switch</strong> </p>

  </p>
  
  <p> 丘명hen get target apply <strong>Harmonic reduction</strong> for mid speed (90 degree) </p>

   <p> 丘명hen <strong>press plus button</strong> go from 50 % of power to 90% power  by applying <strong>Soft switch</strong> </p>

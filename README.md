## Description
<p>âš¡Here I simulate Vaccuum cleaner functionality as when <strong>power on</strong> power of motor go from low power to high power gradually </p>
<p>âš¡ðŸŽ›can control speed (Low  , meduim & High ) and know bag that store dust is full of when led of pressure be on and speed of motor reduce gradually to low </p>

 ## Control Speed
 <p> âš¡here will explain how control speed to motors as power come from sin wave ðŸ‘€always look at contex diagram <p/>
 <p> âš¡power come from AC power source go through zero crossing detector (ZCD) as work crystal </p>
 <p> âš¡A triac is a type of thyristor, a semiconductor component that is used for AC switching applications. It is a three-terminal device that is used to control the flow of electrical current in AC circuits</p>
